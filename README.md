# A React application that implements an image search functionality using an API.

The app has several components, such as Searchbar, ImageGallery, Button, Loader, and Modal. The App component manages the state and controls the rendering of these components based on the user's interaction and the state of the app.

When the user clicks on an image, the app opens a modal window to display the larger version of the image. The Modal component is used for this purpose.

The app uses the useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and handle side effects such as fetching data from the API. The app also uses CSS modules to style the components.
